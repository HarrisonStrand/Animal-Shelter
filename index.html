    <h1>Animals Bizzare</h1>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Ralph The Kiwi</h2>
      <p>Having smuggled his way to the United States on a cruise ship gone horribly wrong, Ralph is in need of a gentle home. He enjoys head scratches and fruit.</p>
      <h2>Winston The Ring-Tailed Lemur</h2>
      <p> Originally trained as a personal butler, Winston is an expert at answering emails, making coffee in the morning, and bringing you mimosas poolside. Always needs tasks and attention. Only answers to "Winston" in a whining british accent.</p>
      <h2>Bob The Cat</h2>
      <p> Struggling with an identity crisis, Bob sometimes thinks that he's a dog. He barks, chases balls, and feels aggressive towards bones. Please sympathize with his struggles as he goes through life.</p>
